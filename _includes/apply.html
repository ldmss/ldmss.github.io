In the poster you can report on unpublished analysis of simulated or experimental data, elaborate on an idea that you would like to receive feedback on, or you can present the results from a paper that you recently published. It should be related to learning and decision making, broadly conceived.</li>
                        <li><strong>One reference letter</strong>: A reference letter sent to us on your behalf, detailing why you are a good candidate for the summer school. Ideally this letter should be written by a person that is familiar with your academic achievements. This is required for master students and early career researchers.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>There will be a 50 EUR participation fee that will have to be paid on accepting an offer.</p>
